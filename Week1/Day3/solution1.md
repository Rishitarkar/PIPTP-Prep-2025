Let's analyze the pseudocode step by step:

### ðŸ§  **Pseudocode:**

```plaintext
1. Integer a, b
2. Set a = 3, b = 3
3. a = b             â†’ a becomes 3 (no change)
4. if (1 ^ 1)        â†’ XOR operation
5.     a = 1
6. Else
7.     b = 2
8. End if
9. Print a + b
```

---

### âœ… **Step-by-Step Execution:**

* `1 ^ 1` = `0` â†’ because XOR of two same bits is `0`.
* So, the `if` condition is **false**, and the `else` block runs.
* In the `else`, `b = 2`.

Now:

* `a = 3`
* `b = 2`

### âž• Final Output = `a + b = 3 + 2 = 5`

### âœ… Correct Answer: **Option C: 5** âœ…
