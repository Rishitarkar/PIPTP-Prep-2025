Let's analyze the pseudocode step by step:

---

###  **Pseudocode:**

```plaintext
1. Integer a, b
2. Set a = 3, b = 3
3. a = b             → a becomes 3 (no change)
4. if (1 ^ 1)        → XOR operation
5.     a = 1
6. Else
7.     b = 2
8. End if
9. Print a + b
```

---

###  **Step-by-Step Execution:**

* `1 ^ 1` = `0` → because XOR of two same bits is `0`.
* So, the `if` condition is **false**, and the `else` block runs.
* In the `else`, `b = 2`.

Now:

* `a = 3`
* `b = 2`

###  Final Output = `a + b = 3 + 2 = 5`

###  Correct Answer: **Option C: 5**
